# Player Vs. Player Blackjack Game

Did you know that Blackjack is the most widely played casino banking game in the world? Grab a friend and try this version of player vs. player Blackjack, you'll love it!

This game works by having two players, each with one starting card. Every click on the hit button will allow each player to add a card to their hand, with the stand button to end their turn. Players will have one turn each. The game will immediately end if any player's score goes beyond 21, where that player loses; or if both scores are below 21, the player with the highest score wins.
